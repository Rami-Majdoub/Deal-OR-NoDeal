# Deal OR NoDeal
A game written as a windows application inspired by the Facebook game 'Deal OR NoDeal' and the television game show 'Dlilek Mlak'.</br>
Used the 'PictureBox' and the 'Label' components in the user interface to represent all the objects.</br>
Cases('sandouk' in 'Dlilek Mlak') are represented as PictureBoxes and the texts(case values, dealer proposition...) with Labels.</br>
Used also the 'Timer' component to add animation to the withdrawn case value.</br>

The game had many UI/UX problems, these are some of them:
- when the player chooses to open a case(click on the case image) the case remains visible but the value inside it is shown on top of it.
- the dealer offers is represented as a text on top of the screen and if the player chooses to accept it he clicks on it, else he is allowed to keep choosing more cases to open.

Some of the new things I added:
- Every game cost 100.
- The player can spin the wheel once every 24 hours.
